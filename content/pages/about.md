I'm John and I'm a web developer from Greece. Besides documenting what I learn, I was intriged 
by the concept of 'public learning' and having a space of your own. My personal playground I guess.


##My Life in bullets

* **1988** I was born in Rasin, Winsconsin.
* **1992** My family moved to Katerini, Greece.
* **2004** Started playing guitar. Music pretty much became the center of my life.
* **2011** Moved to Vienna, Austria where I was working as a musician.
* **2012** Moved to Chicago. 
* **2013** Came back to Greece. Moved to Thessaloniki, where I took odd jobs to sustain myself. I stopped playing music completely.
