I'm John and I'm a web developer from Greece. Besides documenting what I learn, I was intrigued
by the concept of [public learning](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)([greek translation](https://www.johnraptis.dev/learn-in-public-greek/)) and having a space of my own.

I'm a self-taught dev who wrote his first line of code at the tender age of 28 and got his first job 18 months later. I like to dabble with different technologies and learn new concepts. At the moment I mess around with React and JavaScript in general.
