We have finite storage in our brain. Perhaps too finite.

Since the rise of technology we have access to more information than ever. This is probably nothing news for you. But either you are hipper aware of it or not, it has a profound effect on how you go about your everyday life. How you consume information and how you digest it. In what mood you tune yourself and how you vision yourself in the future.

If you take it all in you'll go insane. If you flush it all out you'll wonder lost with no meaning in the world.

So what to do?

Manage what comes in and what stays in. I not talking about your second brain. That comes later. This has to do more with managing the output. I'm talking about what comes in.

### Boxes

There are 10 empty slots in your brain where you can place boxes full of information. Each box needs resources to maintain. Maintenance not to memorization purposes but kinda being in the back burner. You think of them either a lot of very little. But you do spent fuel for them.

Outside of you there are millions of boxes. Other people's boxes, society's boxes or existential boxes.

You can't take in all the boxes. There is no room. What's is why you should find out what boxes are essential to you.
